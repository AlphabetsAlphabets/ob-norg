# Why Is Linear Algebra Important
Linear algebra is important because [[102 Data#Data | tabular data]] can be represented as matrices or as a vector like in [[102 Using the data#Data represented as vectors]].

Vectors are used for dimensionality reduction with principle component analysis and solves least-square problems. Solving issues with vectors called solving [[101 Systems of linear equations from vector equations]].
